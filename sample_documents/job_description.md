# Product Engineer (Backend) Job Description - company 2025

## Position Overview
company is hiring a Product Engineer (Backend) to work on company. We're looking for dedicated engineers who write code they're proud of and who are eager to keep scaling and improving complex systems, including those powered by AI.

## About the Job
You'll be building new product features alongside a frontend engineer and product manager using our Agile methodology, as well as addressing issues to ensure our apps are robust and our codebase is clean. As a Product Engineer, you'll write clean, efficient code to enhance our product's codebase in meaningful ways.

In addition to classic backend work, this role also touches on building AI-powered systems, where you'll design and orchestrate how large language models (LLMs) integrate into company's product ecosystem.

## Key Responsibilities

### Backend Development
- Collaborating with frontend engineers and 3rd parties to build robust backend solutions that support highly configurable platforms and cross-platform integration
- Developing and maintaining server-side logic for central database, ensuring high performance throughput and response time
- Writing reusable, testable, and efficient code to improve the functionality of our existing systems
- Strengthening our test coverage with RSpec to build robust and reliable web apps

### AI/LLM Integration
- Designing and fine-tuning AI prompts that align with product requirements and user contexts
- Building LLM chaining flows, where the output from one model is reliably passed to and enriched by another
- Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by embedding and retrieving context from vector databases, then injecting it into AI prompts to improve accuracy and relevance
- Handling long-running AI processes gracefully â€” including job orchestration, async background workers, and retry mechanisms
- Designing safeguards for uncontrolled scenarios: managing failure cases from 3rd party APIs and mitigating the randomness/nondeterminism of LLM outputs
- Leveraging AI tools and workflows to increase team productivity (e.g., AI-assisted code generation, automated QA, internal bots)

### Product Development
- Conducting full product lifecycles, from idea generation to design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance
- Providing input on technical feasibility, timelines, and potential product trade-offs, working with business divisions
- Actively engaging with users and stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into backend and AI-driven improvements
