# Project Scoring Rubric

## Overview
This rubric provides standardized criteria for evaluating project deliverables against the case study requirements. Each parameter is scored on a 1-5 scale and weighted according to importance.

## Project Deliverable Evaluation Parameters

### 1. Correctness (Prompt & Chaining) (Weight: 30%)

**Description**: Implements prompt design, LLM chaining, RAG context injection, and meets core requirements.

- **4 (Good)**: Works correctly, meets most requirements
- **5 (Excellent)**: Fully correct with thoughtful implementation

**Key Requirements**:
- Proper prompt engineering and design
- LLM chaining implementation (output from one model passed to another)
- RAG context injection (embedding and retrieving context from vector databases)
- API endpoint functionality
- Asynchronous job processing (job orchestration, background workers)
- Document upload and storage
- Handling long-running AI processes gracefully
- Retry mechanisms and error handling for AI APIs
- Managing randomness/nondeterminism of LLM outputs

### 2. Code Quality & Structure (Weight: 25%)

**Description**: Clean, modular, reusable, and well-tested code with good architecture.

**Scoring Guide**:
- **1 (Poor)**: Poor code quality, no structure
- **2 (Below Average)**: Some structure, basic organization
- **3 (Average)**: Decent modularity, readable code
- **4 (Good)**: Good structure with some tests
- **5 (Excellent)**: Excellent quality with comprehensive tests

### 3. Resilience & Error Handling (Weight: 20%)

**Description**: Handles long-running jobs, retries, randomness, and API failures gracefully.

**Scoring Guide**:
- **1 (Poor)**: Missing error handling, no resilience
- **2 (Below Average)**: Minimal error handling
- **3 (Average)**: Partial handling of common errors
- **4 (Good)**: Solid error handling and recovery
- **5 (Excellent)**: Robust, production-ready resilience

**Resilience Features**:
- LLM API retry logic with backoff
- Timeout handling
- Rate limit management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Graceful degradation
- Monitoring and logging
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Handling failure cases from 3rd party APIs
- Mitigating randomness/nondeterminism of LLM outputs
- Job orchestration and async background workers
- Safeguards for uncontrolled scenarios

### 4. Documentation & Explanation (Weight: 15%)

**Description**: Clear README, setup instructions, and explanation of trade-offs and design decisions.

**Scoring Guide**:
- **1 (Poor)**: Missing documentation
- **2 (Below Average)**: Minimal documentation
- **3 (Average)**: Adequate setup instructions
- **4 (Good)**: Clear documentation with examples
- **5 (Excellent)**: Excellent documentation with insights

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Comprehensive README
- Setup and installation instructions
- API documentation
- Architecture explanation
- Design decision rationale
- Trade-off analysis
- Troubleshooting guide

### 5. Creativity / Bonus (Weight: 10%)

**Description**: Extra features beyond requirements, innovative solutions, and thoughtful enhancements.

**Scoring Guide**:
- **1 (Poor)**: No additional features
- **2 (Below Average)**: Very basic extras
- **3 (Average)**: Useful additional features
- **4 (Good)**: Strong enhancements
- **5 (Excellent)**: Outstanding creativity and innovation

**Bonus Features**:
- Authentication and authorization
- Admin dashboard or monitoring
- Advanced caching strategies
- API rate limiting
- Deployment configuration
- Performance optimization
- Security enhancements
- User interface improvements

## Overall Project Score Calculation

**Formula**: 
```
Project Score = (Correctness × 0.3 + Code Quality × 0.25 + 
                Resilience × 0.2 + Documentation × 0.15 + Creativity × 0.1)
```

**Result Range**: 1.0 to 5.0

## Feedback Guidelines

### Project Feedback Structure
Provide 2-3 sentences covering:
1. **Strengths**: What was implemented well
2. **Gaps**: Areas that need improvement
3. **Recommendation**: Specific suggestions for enhancement

### Example Feedback
"Excellent implementation of the core RAG system with thoughtful prompt engineering and robust error handling. The code is well-structured and includes comprehensive documentation. However, the system could benefit from more sophisticated retry logic and additional monitoring capabilities. Overall, this demonstrates strong technical skills and attention to production considerations."

## Consistency Guidelines
- Evaluate based on actual implementation
- Consider the complexity of requirements
- Focus on production readiness
- Assess both technical and non-technical aspects
- Provide constructive, actionable feedback
- Maintain professional evaluation standards
