# CV Scoring Rubric

## Overview
This rubric provides standardized criteria for evaluating candidate CVs against job requirements. Each parameter is scored on a 1-5 scale and weighted according to importance.

## CV Evaluation Parameters

### 1. Technical Skills Match (Weight: 40%)

**Description**: Alignment with job requirements including backend development, databases, APIs, cloud technologies, and AI/LLM exposure.

**Scoring Guide**:
- **1 (Poor)**: Irrelevant skills, no alignment with job requirements
- **2 (Below Average)**: Few overlaps, minimal relevant experience
- **3 (Average)**: Partial match, some relevant skills demonstrated
- **4 (Good)**: Strong match, most required skills present
- **5 (Excellent)**: Excellent match with AI/LLM exposure, exceeds requirements

**Key Skills to Look For**:
- Backend development (Python/Django, Node.js, Rails)
- Database experience (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- API development (RESTful APIs)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- AI/LLM integration experience (LLM APIs, embeddings, vector databases)
- Prompt design and RAG systems
- System architecture and design
- Testing frameworks (RSpec, unit tests)
- Security compliance
- Authentication and authorization systems

### 2. Experience Level (Weight: 25%)

**Description**: Years of experience and complexity of projects undertaken.

**Scoring Guide**:
- **1 (Poor)**: Less than 1 year or only trivial projects
- **2 (Below Average)**: 1-2 years with basic projects
- **3 (Average)**: 2-3 years with mid-scale projects
- **4 (Good)**: 3-4 years with solid track record
- **5 (Excellent)**: 5+ years with high-impact projects

**Factors to Consider**:
- Total years of professional experience
- Project complexity and scale
- Leadership roles and responsibilities
- Industry experience relevance
- Progression in career

### 3. Relevant Achievements (Weight: 20%)

**Description**: Impact of past work including scaling, performance improvements, and adoption.

**Scoring Guide**:
- **1 (Poor)**: No clear achievements demonstrated
- **2 (Below Average)**: Minimal improvements mentioned
- **3 (Average)**: Some measurable outcomes
- **4 (Good)**: Significant contributions with metrics
- **5 (Excellent)**: Major measurable impact with quantifiable results

**Achievement Indicators**:
- Performance improvements (speed, efficiency)
- System scaling and optimization
- User adoption and engagement metrics
- Cost savings or revenue impact
- Technical innovations or patents
- Open source contributions

### 4. Cultural / Collaboration Fit (Weight: 15%)

**Description**: Communication skills, learning mindset, teamwork, and leadership potential.

**Scoring Guide**:
- **1 (Poor)**: Not demonstrated in CV
- **2 (Below Average)**: Minimal evidence of soft skills
- **3 (Average)**: Average communication and collaboration
- **4 (Good)**: Good interpersonal skills demonstrated
- **5 (Excellent)**: Excellent and well-demonstrated leadership

**Indicators to Look For**:
- Clear, well-structured CV presentation
- Team leadership or mentoring experience
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Continuous learning and certifications
- Community involvement or speaking
- Problem-solving approach description

## Overall CV Match Rate Calculation

**Formula**: 
```
CV Match Rate = (Technical Skills × 0.4 + Experience Level × 0.25 + 
                Relevant Achievements × 0.2 + Cultural Fit × 0.15) / 5
```

**Result Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (converted to decimal by multiplying by 0.2)

## Evaluation Guidelines

### Positive Indicators
- Clear progression in career
- Quantifiable achievements with metrics
- Relevant technical certifications
- Open source contributions
- Leadership or mentoring experience
- Continuous learning and adaptation

### Red Flags
- Gaps in employment without explanation
- Vague or generic descriptions
- No quantifiable achievements
- Irrelevant experience for the role
- Poor CV formatting or presentation
- Lack of technical depth

### AI/LLM Experience Bonus (Highly Valued)
- Direct experience with AI/ML projects
- LLM integration or prompt engineering
- Vector database or RAG system experience
- AI-powered application development
- Machine learning model deployment
- Experience with LLM chaining flows
- Handling long-running AI processes
- Managing AI API failures and retry mechanisms
- AI-assisted development tools and workflows

## Feedback Guidelines

### CV Feedback Structure
Provide 2-3 sentences covering:
1. **Strengths**: What the candidate does well
2. **Gaps**: Areas that need improvement
3. **Recommendation**: Next steps or concerns

### Example Feedback
"Strong technical background in backend development with solid experience in Python and cloud technologies. Demonstrates good project management skills and quantifiable achievements in system optimization. However, limited exposure to AI/LLM technologies which is increasingly important for this role. Would benefit from additional experience in modern AI integration patterns."

## Consistency Guidelines
- Use the same criteria for all candidates
- Focus on objective, measurable factors
- Consider the specific job requirements
- Maintain professional tone in feedback
- Provide actionable insights
